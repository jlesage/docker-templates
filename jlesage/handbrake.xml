  <Overview>
HandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

Also, being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.

A fully automated mode is also available: drop files into a watch folder and let HandBrake process them without any user interaction.

- Take ownership of the `/output` folder.
- Added the ability to remove video source files from the watch folder after successfully conversion.

###v1.0.1 (2017-05-18)
- The watch folder is now monitored without inotify for better compatibility.

###v1.0.0 (2017-05-18)
- Initial release.
