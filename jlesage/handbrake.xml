  <Overview>
HandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the application can be accessed through a modern web browser, requiring no installation or configuration on the client side, or via any VNC client.

The container is built against Alpine Linux to provide an efficient image in terms of size and resource usage.

A fully automated mode is also available: drop files into a watch folder and let HandBrake process them without any user interaction.

For a complete documentation of this container, see https://github.com/jlesage/docker-handbrake#readme
