  <Overview>
CrashPlan provides peace of mind through secure, scalable, and straightforward endpoint data backup. We help organizations recover from any worst-case scenario, whether it is a disaster, simple human error, a stolen laptop, ransomware or an as-of-yet undiscovered calamity.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

Also, being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.

This Docker container can be used with all CrashPlan products: Essential, Professional, Enterprise, MSPs and Small Business (no longer sold).

For a complete documentation of this container, see https://github.com/jlesage/docker-crashplan-pro#readme

**Warning**: Make sure to read the *Taking Over Existing Backup* section of the documentation if you are installing this container to replace another CrashPlan installation (from Windows, Linux, Mac or even another Docker container).
