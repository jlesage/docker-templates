  <Overview>
Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks.  It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs.  Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful scripting capabilities.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

Also, being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.

For a complete documentation of this container, see https://github.com/jlesage/docker-avidemux#readme
