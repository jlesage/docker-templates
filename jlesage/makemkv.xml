  <Overview>
MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

Also, being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.

A fully automated mode is also available: insert a DVD or Blu-ray disc into an optical drive and let MakeMKV rips it without any user interaction.

For a complete documentation of this container, see https://github.com/jlesage/docker-makemkv#readme

**NOTE**: For the container to have access to your optical drive(s), you need to add them to your container configuration.  This is done by adding a new "Device".  An optical drive is represented by two Linux device files: "/dev/srX" and "/dev/sgY".  For optimal performance, the container needs both of them.  To determine the right devices to use, start the container and look at its log.
