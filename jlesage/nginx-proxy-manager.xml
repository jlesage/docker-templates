  <Overview>
Nginx Proxy Manager enables you to easily forward to your websites running at home or otherwise, including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx or Letsencrypt.

Being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.

For a complete documentation of this container, see https://github.com/jlesage/docker-nginx-proxy-manager#readme

**NOTE**: For this container to be accessible from the internet, make sure ports **80** and **443** on the internet side of your router are properly forwarded to this container.  See the documentation for more details. **NOTE**: After a fresh install, the default username/password to connect to the management interface are: > admin@example.com/changeme.
