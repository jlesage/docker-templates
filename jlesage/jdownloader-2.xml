  <Overview>
JDownloader 2 is a free, open-source download management tool with a huge community of developers that makes downloading as easy and fast as it should be. Users can start, stop or pause downloads, set bandwith limitations, auto-extract archives and much more. It's an easy-to-extend framework that can save hours of your valuable time every day!

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

Also, being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.

For a complete documentation of this container, see https://github.com/jlesage/docker-jdownloader-2#readme
