  <Overview>
tsMuxer is a Transport Stream muxer. Remux/mux elementary streams, EVO/VOB/MPG, MKV/MKA, MP4/MOV, TS, M2TS to TS to M2TS. Supported video codecs H.264, VC-1, MPEG2. Supported audio codecs AAC, AC3 / E-AC3(DD+), DTS/ DTS-HD. Ability to set muxing fps manually and automatically, change level for H.264 streams, shift sound tracks, extract DTS core from DTS-HD, join files. Output/author to compliant Blu-ray Disc or AVCHD.  Blu-ray 3D support.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

Also, being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.
