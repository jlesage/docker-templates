  <Overview>
dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It can scan either filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

Also, being based on Alpine Linux, size of this container is very small.

For a complete documentation of this container, see https://github.com/jlesage/docker-dupeguru#readme
